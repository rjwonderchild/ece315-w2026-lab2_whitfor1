Processing Lab Questions

Part 1:

Formal Questions:
1. Why do we use non-blocking operations in polling-based systems?
2. Why must a delay be included inside each polling loop?
3. How does the polling period affect system responsiveness and CPU usage?
4. What problems can airse if a polling loop is implemented incorrectly?
5. How can you determine an appropriate polling period for your system?
6. What happens if a high-priority task busy-waits in a FreeRTOS system?

Coding Decisions:
Problem #1:
When first starting the program, we are met with this error: Assert failed in file C:/Users/whitfor1/Desktop/ece315_lab2/lab2_part1/lab2_part1.c, line 747324309678
Question: Why the assertion occured? What condition was being checked?

Solution:
This is occuring since q_tx (the transmission queue) was declared but the instance had not been created. So inside main, we added;
q_tx      = xQueueCreate(TX_QUEUE_LEN, sizeof(uint8_t));
Problem solved!
The assertion occurs because at line 174, configASSERT(q_tx); validates that q_tx actually has a queue associated with this variable,
but since it was not intialized, the assertion fails.

Problem #2:
Identify the errors within UART_RX_Task.
Question: Explain what busy waiting is and why it is problematic in an RTOS-Based system.

Solution:
